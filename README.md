# Infer-RainPredRNN2
This repository contains a standalone Python script to **run inference and performance benchmarking** for the `RainPredRNN` deep learning model.   The script loads a trained checkpoint, performs multiple inference repetitions for timing, and exports the predicted radar rainfall maps as GeoTIFF files.
